# HR-Analytic-Classification

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the eligibility of an employee to be promoted or not.
Human resources have used analytics for years. However, data collection, processing and analysis is mostly done manually.
This problem will be solved through a Supervised Machine Learning approach by training a model based on features. 
The trained model will then be used to make predictions on an employee to be promoted or not.
